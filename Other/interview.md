Interview of Museum Personell:
- What kind of information would you like an analytics device in your facility to provide?
- Some museums use RFID trackers to understand visitor movement patterns and see where they spend the most time. What are your thoughts on using RFID trackers for this purpose?
- How important is it to know the exact positions of visitors within the museum?
- Certain devices can detect situations like a person falling. Are there specific incidents or situations you would like a system to monitor in the aquarium or throughout the museum?
- There's technology available to measure and track the mood of museum visitors. Can you think of any ways this information could be useful for your museum?
- HallMonitor devices delete images after analysis to ensure privacy, without anyone viewing them. How do you feel about having cameras in the museum under these conditions?
- The aquarium is usually colder than the outside temperature during summer. Do you think this affects how long visitors stay in the aquarium? Do you know if visitors leave earlier than planned due to the cold?
- How do you currently gather feedback or data about visitor experiences and satisfaction?
