abstract = {We describe a technique to detect the presence of computer users. This technique relies on sonar using hardware that already exists on commodity laptop computers and other electronic devices. It leverages the fact that human bodies have a different effect on sound waves than air and other objects. We conducted a user study in which 20 volunteers used a computer equipped with our ultrasonic sonar software. Our results show that it is possible to detect the presence or absence of users with near perfect accuracy after only ten seconds of measurement. We find that this technique can differentiate varied user positions and actions, opening the possibility of future use in estimating attention level.},

abstract = {A computer views all kinds of visual media as an array of numerical values. As a consequence of this approach, they require image processing algorithms to inspect contents of images. This project compares 3 major image processing algorithms: Single Shot Detection (SSD), Faster Region based Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNN), and You Only Look Once (YOLO) to find the fastest and most efficient of three. In this comparative analysis, using the Microsoft COCO (Common Object in Context) dataset, the performance of these three algorithms is evaluated and their strengths and limitations are analysed based on parameters such as accuracy, precision and F1 score. From the results of the analysis, it can be concluded that the suitability of any of the algorithms over the other two is dictated to a great extent by the use cases they are applied in. In an identical testing environment, YOLO-v3 outperforms SSD and Faster R-CNN, making it the best of the three algorithms.},

abstract="With the rapid growth of edge intelligence, a higher level of deep neural network computing efficiency is required. Visual intelligence, as the core component of artificial intelligence, is particularly worth more exploration. As the cornerstone of modern visual modeling, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have greatly developed in the past decades. Variants of light-weight CNNs have also been proposed to address the challenge of heavy computing in mobile settings. Though CNNs' spatial inductive biases allow them to learn representations with fewer parameters across different vision tasks, these models are spatially local. To acquire a next-level model performance, vision transformer (ViT) is now a viable alternative due to the potential of multi-head attention mechanism. In this work, we introduce EdgeViT, an accelerated deep visual modeling method that incorporates the benefits of CNNs and ViTs in a light-weight and edge-friendly manner. Our proposed method can achieve top-1 accuracy of 77.8{\%} using only 2.3 million parameters, 79.2{\%} using 5.6 million parameters on ImageNet-1k dataset. It can achieve mIoU up to 78.3 on PASCAL VOC segmentation while only using 3.1 million parameters which is only half of MobileViT parameter budget.",

abstract = {Falling is among the most damaging event elderly people may experience. With the ever-growing aging population, there is an urgent need for the development of fall detection systems. Thanks to the rapid development of sensor networks and the Internet of Things (IoT), human-computer interaction using sensor fusion has been regarded as an effective method to address the problem of fall detection. In this paper, we provide a literature survey of work conducted on elderly fall detection using sensor networks and IoT. Although there are various existing studies which focus on the fall detection with individual sensors, such as wearable ones and depth cameras, the performance of these systems are still not satisfying as they suffer mostly from high false alarms. Literature shows that fusing the signals of different sensors could result in higher accuracy and lower false alarms, while improving the robustness of such systems. We approach this survey from different perspectives, including data collection, data transmission, sensor fusion, data analysis, security, and privacy. We also review the benchmark data sets available that have been used to quantify the performance of the proposed methods. The survey is meant to provide researchers in the field of elderly fall detection using sensor networks with a summary of progress achieved up to date and to identify areas where further effort would be beneficial.},

abstract = {Video of in-home activity provides valuable information for assistive monitoring but raises privacy concerns. Raw video can be privacy-enhanced by obscuring the appearance of a person. We consider five privacy enhancements: blur, silhouette, oval, box, and trailing-arrows. We investigate whether a privacy enhancement exists that provides sufficient perceived privacy while enabling accurate fall detection by humans. We recorded 23 1-minute videos involving normal household activities, falling, and lying on the floor after an earlier fall, and created versions of each video for each privacy setting. We conducted an experiment with 376 undergraduate, non-engineering student participants to measure perceived privacy protection and the participant's fall detection accuracy for each privacy setting. Results indicate that the oval provides sufficient perceived privacy for 88\% of participants while still supporting fall detection accuracy of 89\%, and that the common privacy enhancements blur and silhouette were perceived to provide insufficient privacy.},

A novel taxonomy with which state-of-the-art visual privacy protection methods can be classified is introduced. Perceptual obfuscation methods, a category in this taxonomy, is highlighted. These are a category of visual privacy preservation techniques, particularly relevant when considering scenarios that come under video-based AAL monitoring. Obfuscation against machine learning models is also explored. A high-level classification scheme of privacy by design, as defined by experts in privacy and data protection law, is connected to the proposed taxonomy of visual privacy preservation techniques. Finally, we note open questions that exist in the field and introduce the reader to some exciting avenues for future research in the area of visual privacy.},
