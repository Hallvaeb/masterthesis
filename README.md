## AMUND: "main.pdf" in the the top level directory (same level as this readme) should be the most updated version of my thesis.

This master thesis project is under development. Feel free to read, but it's not meant for other than myself (version control) and my supervisor Amund Skavhaug. Let me know if you're interested or have comments at hallvard.bjorgen@gmail.com.

I've written in VSCode using the LaTeX Workshop extension and compiled with "Latexmk, John Collins, 24 Dec. 2023. Version 4.82".

Note to self: Run latexmk to generate latex document, or save any of the .tex files.
