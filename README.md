## AMUND: "main.pdf" in the the top level directory (same level as this readme) should be the most updated version of my thesis.

I've written in VSCode using the LaTeX Workshop extension and compiled with "Latexmk, John Collins, 24 Dec. 2023. Version 4.82".

Note to self: Run latexmk to generate latex document, or save any of the .tex files.
