\section{Future Work}

Recommendations for future work include the following.



\subsection{Data Visualization Tools}

\subsubsection{Heat Map Generation with more Variables}
Other variables could have been integrated in the solution to create more insights. This could be temperature, weather or light data, measuring if the visitation patterns change based on any of these variables. Once the initial technology of being able to localize humans in a space in a privacy preservant way, experimenting with more data variables to improve insights could prove beneficial. 

\subsubsection{Zones}
\label{sec:zones}
Another great visualization would be to visualize the number of detections in front of each exhibition. This would allow for an easy-to-grasp and useful visualization of where visitors most frequently stand, giving indications to what exhibition is most popular (or time-consuming). 

\subsubsection{Queue Formation Areas}
