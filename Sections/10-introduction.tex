\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have notably enhanced models' capabilities to extract valuable information from images. This is particularly relevant for indoor positioning systems (IPS) with extended capabilities to detect falls or signals for help. Traditionally, various non-visual sensors such as wearable devices, passive infrared sensors (PIR), radio-frequency identification (RFID), and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) have been utilized in IPS. These technologies preserve privacy effectively as they are mostly incapable of identifying personal data. However, for future applications requiring detailed context and capabilities, these sensors fall short where visual sensors excel.

The emergence of automated \textit{on-device} processing marks a significant progression in privacy preservation of visual sensors in IPS. With on-device processing, images no longer need to be analyzed manually or transmitted over the internet, allowing for the creation of more advanced and comprehensive systems. As highlighted by \citeauthor{s22218119}, integrating indoor positioning systems (IPS) with human activity recognition (HAR) is essential to detect incidents like falls or injuries, especially among elderly individuals living alone (\citeyear{s22218119}). 

This thesis explores the development and deployment of a privacy-preservant person locatization system, particularly advocating for on-device processing to mitigate privacy concerns. As part of the on-device processing, sensitive data, such as images, are either deleted or obfuscated immediately after inference, complicating analysis validation but significantly enhancing privacy.

Typically, machine learning models for person detection are pretrained on large, generic datasets and validated on similar datasets, which may not accurately represent specific deployment scenarios. This thesis addresses this gap by collecting a specialized dataset in a typical dark-lit indoor museum/aquarium setting and evaluating various detectors fine-tuned to this environment. A month-long live experiment was conducted at the Fisheries and Maritime Museums (FIMUS) aquarium to assess these systems' real-world applicability. During this experiment, some images were blurred and retained to verify the model's inferences, enhancing our understanding of their practical utility and limitations.

Figure \ref{fig:example_from_aquarium}a displays an example image from the collected FIMUS dataset, while Figure \ref{fig:example_from_aquarium}b shows an image from the live experiment that was kept for verification purposes.

\subsection{Problem Description}
\label{sec:problem_description}
Recent advancements in computer vision and machine learning have transformed the field of person localization in public spaces. Traditionally, surveillance systems rely on centralized processing, where video feeds are sent to a remote server for analysis. This method poses significant privacy risks as it exposes sensitive information to potential interception during transmission. This thesis advocates for a shift towards \textit{on-device} processing, where analytics are performed locally on edge devices, thus enhancing privacy by eliminating the need to transmit raw video data. Another aspect of on-device processing is to algorithmically analyze the video feed by the use of machine learning, instead of humans.

Additionally, the efficacy of object detection models is commonly measured using generic datasets like COCO, which may not accurately represent the specific conditions and image characteristics of a real-world deployment environment. Such discrepancies can result in models performing suboptimally in actual settings, where variables like lighting, camera angle viewpoint, scale, rotation, and object occlusion play crucial roles. The quality and relevance of the data used to test and train a model for deployment should be as similar to the deployment scenario as possible. However, assessing the impact of dataset relevancy and quality on model accuracy presents substantial challenges, with limited research available on this subject. Consumers are thus left in the dark by the researchers in the field with regards to how much effort should be put into finding the best suited test dataset for model testing and fine-tuning.


\subsection{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}
To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of on-device person localization, two devices were deployed at the \textit{Fisheries and Maritime Museum}\footnote{In original language: Fiskeri og SÃ¸fartsmuseet} (FIMUS) aquarium in Esbjerg, Denmark. The indoor, low-light conditions of the aquarium presented specific challenges that the deployment aimed to address. The deployment camera angle viewpoint on the persons in the area was different than most images in the COCO dataset that the models were pre-trained on. For this reason, a dataset consisting of 3,397 images was collected and labeled, providing a foundation for fine-tuning several object detector models to better fit the deployment scenario, and to investigate the impacts of dataset relevancy on the model performances. The dataset was collected using varying and fixed camera configurations, creating a dataset capable of investigation of data quality (different camera configurations) on the model accuracies. Figure \ref{fig:example_from_aquarium} showcases an example image from this dataset. During the final month of the project, a device was deployed to anonymously and automatically detect the positions of persons\footnote{\textit{People: Where individual persons, or a number of such, are intended, this word should be discarded in favor of persons.(\cite{vizetelly2015deskbook}).}} in the room every 2 minutes during opening hours. The data was visualized through heatmaps and bar charts of peak visitation times of the day. 

The scope of this thesis is twofold: firstly, the thesis details a demonstation of the implementation of a privacy-preserving person localization system; secondly, the thesis assesses the validity of object detection model performances across general and specific datasets to evaluate the real-world impacts of scientific advancements. This dualistic approach not only highlights the practical application of privacy technologies in object detection but also investigates how different data environments affect model efficacy.

The inclusion of a previously implemented system serves as a practical foundation for this thesis, shortening the theoretical to practical implementation pathway. By utilizing the images from the specific deployment scenario, thus specializing our solution to the problem, the thesis project aims to achieve superior results at the expense of reduced generalizability. However, the general nature of the thesis ensures that the findings and methodologies can be adapted and applied to other problems with similar characteristics.

This thesis is selectively deep on topics such as privacy, privacy preservation in images, and performance metrics of object detectors. These areas are emphasized due to their critical relevance and the necessity of a fundamental understanding of these topics to grasp the project's core objectives. While other subjects like object detector model architecture, edge devices, challenges in object detection, security, and decision support systems also present interesting avenues of exploration, they are not central to the thesis' primary aims.

This thesis is intended for a diverse reader group, including technical engineers, technical leaders, non-technical social studies scholars, and policymakers engaged in crafting regulations for object detection technologies. This results in a broad scope of topics covered in the thesis, ranging from technical discussions on machine learning models to ethical considerations for the deployment of person localization systems in public spaces. The project of this thesis also spanned several technological disciplines. It required research, development, and effort in edge-device deployment, machine learning, and data science. The scope was limited to manage the workload effectively, see the Limitations section below. 

\subsection{Limitations}
\paragraph{Secure Control of Device}
\phantomsection
\label{sec:scope_ssh}
A dataset was built of consenting individuals in an aquarium which was part of a larger museum facility. However, once development was finished and the system was tested, the devices were actively photographing individuals who had \textit{not} given consent to be photographed. Privacy was still preserved by immediately inferencing on and deleting the images. In such an application, it is imperative to not store or upload clear, privacy-intrusive images. Therefore, an existing and already proven secure solution developed by \textit{HallMonitor}, a company specializing in on-device processing solutions based in Esbjerg, was utilized to establish a secure communication channel with the deployed devices. The communication channel was used to extract the analytics data from the devices. This secure system setup, necessary to protect the devices from attackers, is not covered in this thesis due to its proprietary nature.

\paragraph{Legal Considerations}
The discussions and insights in this thesis may apply to global applications, but the legal considerations specifically target the European Union member countries. Further, some of the discussions may be influenced and biased by a heavily european-influenced cultural mindset and thus not be as relevant and applicable to parts outside Europe. More detailed discussions on international privacy laws beyond just the GDPR should have been included if the technology was intended for global application. Additionally, this thesis does not encompass medical device regulations (MDR) neccessary for devices used for medical purposes on humans.

\paragraph{Fine-tuned Model Development}
The project's broad scope resulted in a limited exploration of potential improvements in model fine-tuning. This thesis evaluates the performance of various machine learning models, including models built from the three arhitectures YOLOv3, YOLOv9, and DETR. Two more object detection architectures are also mentioned, but were not (fully) implemented. These are Co-DETR, the current best-performing model on the COCO dataset, and the Faster-RCNN, another popular and good option for object detection. However, the Co-DETR was deemed too complex and resource-intensive for the project's scope to be fully implemented and evaluated, and Faster-RCNN was not prioritized due worse performance than the YOLOv9. The object detectors are discussed in Section \ref{sec:object_detection}.

\paragraph{Museum and Aquarium Opening Hours and Visitor Conduct}
\phantomsection
\label{sec:scope_opening_hours}
The project was designed to avoid interference with the normal operations of the aquarium. Consequently, image capture for the dataset was confined to aquarium opening hours, and random visitors were not inquired whether they'd be willing to participate in the project. An early analysis of the visitation patterns revealed the aquarium was busy from the opening at 10:00 until approximately to 15:00, 2 hours before closing time. This meant most images for the dataset were captured in the two hours before closing time where there was least traffic.

\newpage
\paragraph{The Task is Object Detection}
\phantomsection
\label{sec:scope_object_detection}
There are several tasks within the domain of computer vision, each serving distinct purposes and complexities. This project focuses exclusively on simple object detection, which involves locating objects of relevance within an image. Specifically, this thesis addresses single-class object detection with \textit{person} as the sole class of interest. Other tasks in computer vision include person re-identification, image classification, combined image classification and localization, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Re-identification involves recognizing individuals across different images and image classification is the task of classifying the image contents as a whole. The rest of the tasks are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:computer_vision_tasks} to display how they differentiate from object detection. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{Images/computer_vision_tasks.png}
    \caption{Computer Vision Tasks (\cite{mu2021object_detection_operations}).}
    \label{fig:computer_vision_tasks}
\end{figure}

The choice of a machine learning model training dataset is reliant on the specific task to be performed. It must contain data suited for that task. For instance, applications tasked with person reidentification require a dataset that includes the identities across images for the persons depicted in the images. An appropriate dataset for such applications, the Person Reidentification in the Wild (PRW), is detailed in Section \ref{sec:dataset_PRW}. A dataset for object detection purposes needs the bounding box and class id for each identified object in the image. In the case of single-class object detection (person localization), only the bouding boxes for each detection for each image would suffice.

\paragraph{Light Conditions in Aquarium Settings}
\phantomsection
\label{sec:scope_aquarium_light}
The environmental conditions within aquarium settings impose specific lighting requirements that significantly influence the deployment and performance of the proposed object detection system. Aquariums typically maintain low-light conditions, presumably to minimize stress for the aquatic animals and improve vision into the tanks for the visitors. In this context, the options for enhancing illumination are often limited, making it impractical to simply increase lighting to facilitate better visual detection technologies. These subdued lighting conditions were an important feature of the thesis project.

\paragraph{TinyML and Frugal Devices}
\phantomsection
\label{sec:scope_tinyML}
An initial attempt was made to encompass tinyML and frugal devices in the project. TinyML is when machine learning models are aimed at deployment to heavily resource-constrained environments, e.g. "frugal devices". These are devices where the microcontroller units (MCUs) are accompanied by memory measured in kilobytes, and processor speeds measured in megahertz. Machine learning networks applied to tiny robots are subject to challenges from size, weight, area, and power (SWAP) (\cite{ne2022robotstinymlconstraints}). Many of the same challenges apply even in applications where the SWAP challenges are not the main concerns. \citeauthor{ra2023reformabletinyml} mentions the open challenges and future directions of the next generation tinyML. Catastrophic forgetting, which is when information from previous tasks while learning new ones are forgotten, are a result of the frugal devices' computational resources and memory\footnote{Catastrophic forgetting can also be seen in transfer learning, and is why freezing the backbone of a pre-trained model may be a good idea.}. The first recommendation for future directions from the authors is to investigate fog computing as a means to offload tasks from the frugal devices. Exploring a system of frugal devices for obtaining sensor data on the edge and "fog devices"\footnote{Fog devices is an unofficial term for processing-instances located close to the edge.} for processing of the data would be a time-consuming objective, especially in a real-world scenario where security must be taken seriously. Therefore, tinyML and frugal devices are not elaborated in detail in this thesis, but discussed briefly in \ref{app:tinyML}. 

\paragraph{Model Hyperparameter Tuning}
\phantomsection
\label{sec:scope_hyperparameter_tuning}
The project did not encompass hyperparameter tuning of the models. Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the best hyperparameters for a machine learning model. Hyperparameters are the settings of the model that are not learned from the data, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. Hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline, as it can significantly impact the model's performance. However, due to time and resource constraints, hyperparameter tuning was not included in this project. Further comments on hyperparameter tuning are made in Section \ref{sec:hyperparameter_tuning}.

\paragraph{Person Localization System vs Alternative Notations}
In this thesis, the term \textit{person localization system} is employed consistently to describe the technology developed for identifying the positions of individuals. This terminology is preferred as it aligns with the object detection dataset standards where \textit{person} is the designated class name used in object detection model datasets. Furthermore, the choice of "localization" over "positioning" is deliberate to avoid potential confusion; while "positioning" could imply the physical movement or arrangement of persons by the system, "localization" specifically refers to the precise identification of a person's location within a predefined spatial context, accurately reflecting the capabilities and functionality of the implemented system. Additionally, other literature seems to prefer localizatoin over positioning (\cite{gao2016development}), altough similar systems have also been called indoor \textit{positioning} systems.

\subsection{Disclaimers}
\label{sec:disclaimers}
\subsubsection{Reuse of Previous Work by the same Author}
\phantomsection
\label{sec:disclaimer_reuse}
Some of the subsections in the Literature section are heavily based on an unpublished\footnote{The preliminary study is not publicly available, since this is not the default practice of NTNU.} preliminary study for the project of this thesis by the same authors. This preliminary study was written the semester before, and was a theoretical study of how one may achieve "Efficient, accurate, and privacy-preservant object detection in edge devices" (which was its title). This subsections most influenced by the previous work are the subsections \ref{sec:individual_privacy}, \ref{sec:object_detection}, and \ref{sec:thirdparty_products}.

\subsubsection{The Use of AI Tools}
OpenAI's ChatGPT-4/ChatGPT-4o (\cite{openai2024chatgpt}) has been prompted with several sections to get suggestions on how to enhance readability and flow. All AI generated suggestions have been verified and major parts rewritten to better fit the intentions of the sections. The author of this thesis takes full responsibility for all of its content. ChatGPT was also used to identify typos in the text, as a final step in the production of this thesis.

\subsubsection{Privacy of Similar Projects}
The author of this thesis is not an expert in privacy. The methods outlined in this thesis are meant to ensure privacy of individuals, but the author cannot guarantee that the methods are foolproof. The author has tried to follow best practices and guidelines from the field and has tried to be transparent about the methods used and the limitations of the methods, but the reader should be aware that following the methods outlined in this thesis may not necessarily be enough to ensure privacy. An investigation into the privacy of similar projects is recommended before deploying a similar system in a real-world setting.

\subsection{Research Questions}

These technologies provide scalable solutions without the privacy concerns associated with vision-based systems. Museum stakeholders opinions are included in this section. This section presents insights into user perceptions of privacy in smart home environments, which reveal a trade-off between convenience and privacy concerns, indicating similar challenges could arise in public visitor contexts. Section \ref{sec:GDPR} about GDPR seek to illustrate how these challenges are addressed in the current EU regulations. It summarizes the requirements for personal data protection and the legal bases for processing such data, which are directly applicable to any person localization system developed. Together with the NIS2 directive, the GDPR promotes the principle of data minimization, pushing for a solution that deletes unnecessary data as soon as the data is redundant.
